Installation
============

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
$ composer create-project goulaheau/symfony-starter <project-name>
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.
